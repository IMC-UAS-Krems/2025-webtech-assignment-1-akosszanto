            I was born in Sopron, a small town in Hungary near the Austrian
            border. I spent all of my 20 years here. I went to primary and
            secondary school here. Sopron is a place where Roman ruins and
            medieval city walls are a natural part of everyday life. I come home
            here every weekend for my family and the memories.

            My high school was a defining moment in my life, I had a 5-year
            education where IT was the focus. In all 5 years, in addition to
            regular high school subjects, I had a lot of IT-related classes,
            such as web and desktop application development, databases. My fifth
            year was all about software development, since I graduated in the
            fourth year.

            At the end of high school, I thought that if I had been studying
            computer science for 5 years, I should definitely finish it and get
            a degree in it. But at the same time, I feel that I don't want to
            spend my whole life in front of a computer and would rather do
            something more physical. I thought a lot about getting a degree in
            sports, especially basketball. It's possible that in the future I'll
            graduate with a degree in basketball coaching somewhere and I'll
            deal with that.
