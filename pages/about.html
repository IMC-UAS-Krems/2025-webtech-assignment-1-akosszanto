            I was born in Sopron, a small town in Hungary near the Austrian
            border. I spent all of my 20 years here. I went to primary and
            secondary school here. Sopron is a place where Roman ruins and
            medieval city walls are a natural part of everyday life. I come home
            here every weekend for my family and the memories.

            My high school was a defining moment in my life, I had a 5-year
            education where IT was the focus. In all 5 years, in addition to
            regular high school subjects, I had a lot of IT-related classes,
            such as web and desktop application development, databases. My fifth
            year was all about software development, since I graduated in the
            fourth year.

            At the end of the 5. years, we had to take a professional exam in
            high schools to get the software development technician
            certification. It was a multi-round exam, where one of our tasks was
            to create a full stack website in groups of three in 4 months. This
            was the biggest project I have ever participated in.
